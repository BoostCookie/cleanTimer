# cleanTimer
A Java cube timer that's nice and clean! 

I couldn't find a single cube timer app on Google Play that is:

a) looks nice
b) not ridden with ads

So I tried to make my own! 



Tap the screen to start the timer. 
Above the timer is a randomly generated scramble. 
Below the timer is the most recent 5 solves and below that is the average of those 5 solves.

That's it. Not even one banner ad. Or a single prompt asking for IAPs.
